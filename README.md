Reddidn't is a focused Reddit ad blocker built as a modern LSPosed module. It uses DexKit to locate ad-rendering methods by stable strings and structural characteristics instead of relying on obfuscated class or method names.

## Features

- Block promoted posts in feeds.
- Block ads in comment threads.
- Toggle each blocker independently without restarting Reddit.

## Compatibility

The matchers in every release target the Reddit version specified within the release notes (and above) and tolerate minor signature drift in nearby releases. Later Reddit versions are best-effort until they have been tested on a device.

## Requirements

- A rooted Android device.
- An API-101-compatible LSPosed 2.0.x installation.
- Reddit selected in the module's scope.

LSPatch support is not guaranteed.
